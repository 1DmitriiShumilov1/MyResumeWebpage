                <p class="paragraph">Hello, My name is Dima (short for Dmitrii) and currently I am 19 years old. I was born in a city of Perm, Russia in 2001. Before moving to the US,
                I spent 9 years studying different subjects at school. My 2 favorites were English (as a second language) and Maths. As almost every
                kid in this world, I did not always like doing the homework, but I still had some temptation to learn, know more. As you can
                see, I succeeded in learning English. The only thing left for me to do is to succeed in coding.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">I moved to the United States with my mother when I was 16. I didn't have very good grades in my Russian school, so I decided that it is time for me
                    to change myself. At August of 2017, I joined Woodcreek High School as a sophomore. 3 years flew by, and I am already a graduate, class 
                    of 2020. Throughout these 3 years, I believe I got only one C in one class - and it was English; I managed to get all A's and B's in all 
                    of my other classes.

                <p class="paragraph">As for my hobbies, I enjoy learning code, workout, play guitar or computer games, and watch YouTube. I also enjoy traveling, even though 
                    I don't do it that often. Honestly, if I had to pick my favorite hobby, I'd probably pick computer games, but this doesn't stop me from
                    learning how to code and how to be a Web Developer. I understand that it sounds corny, but I don't plan from giving up because I get joy
                    from working with html and scc, and I love feeling of accomplishing something, like building a simple website about myself.
